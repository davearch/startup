Simple Bash Script I made to quickly set up the foundation for web development.


It creates the following on my computer:


	css directory
	-reset.css from Eric Meyers Website
	-1140.css from cssgrid.net
	-ie.css from the same site
	-an override stylesheet with the same name as the parent directory
	
	scripts directory
	-minified version of the latest jquery
	-override js with the same name as the parent directory

	empty images directory
	an index.html with the doctype and my name on top

Right now it is specific to my computer but I plan on making it more general so others can just copy it. It would, however, be really easy to just change the directory that it creates to something you could use. $HOME/$SITENAME, for example, would be short and sweet. That is only on OS X though, I still need to figure it out for Linux and Windows.

Maybe tomorrow...
