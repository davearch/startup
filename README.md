Simple Bash Script I made to quickly set up the foundation for web development.


It creates the following on my computer:
	css directory
	-reset.css from Eric Meyers Website
	-1140.css from cssgrid.net
	-ie.css from the same site
	-an override stylesheet with the same name as the parent directory
	
	
	scripts directory
	-minified version of the latest jquery
	-override js with the same name as the parent directory


	empty images directory
	an index.html with the doctype and my name on top

Right now it is specific to my computer but I plan on making it more general so others can just copy it.

Maybe tomorrow...
